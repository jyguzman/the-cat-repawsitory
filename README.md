# The Dog Repawsitory

## Usage

The easiest way to use the Dog Repawsitory is just to visit its link at https://dogrepawsitory.uc.r.appspot.com! It has been deployed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

You can select a breed by clicking on any of the listed breeds that appear
as you type in the text box. There are 172 available breeds.

The 'Top Dogs' button lists the current 10 most searched breeds. A search
is simply whenever someone selects a breed and its pictures are loaded.

### Local Usage

To run the app locally one must download this repository. Then to run the app, open a terminal in the root directory and type 'npm run dev' to
run the server and client concurrently; the app will be open on 
http://localhost:3000.

## Testing

There are two ways to run the tests: with Replit or locally. 

To run on Replit, visit https://replit.com/@jyguzman/ShopifyChallengeTests and in the shell enter the command "npm test". It is NOT necessary to click the 'Run' button at the top.

To run the tests locally, download the repository, and in the root 
directory open a terminal and enter the command 'npm test'.
